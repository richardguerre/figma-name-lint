# Figma Name Linter

## What is it?

A Figma plugin that allows you to rename all default-named elements in the current page.

Default-named elements include (where N is a number):

- Frame N
- Group N
- Rectangle N
- Eclipse N
  ...

## Why?

This plugin is particularly useful to prepare designs for developer-handoff, where developers usually name their variables and classes using the designers names.

Having the same element names in both Figma and your codebase makes the communication between designers and developer easier, but also makes it easier to backtrace elements from code to design and iterate faster.
